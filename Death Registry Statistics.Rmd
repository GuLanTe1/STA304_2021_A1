# Introduction

first paragraph is motivational and broad by expanding abstract

second paragraph is about what was done and what was found.

third is about implications

the remainder of this paper is: section \@ref(data) explains the data. section \@ref(results) covers results.....

# Data

paragraph or two introducing the dataset broadly.

Then show an extract of the dataset (kable)

```{r}

death_registry <- read.csv("death_registry.csv")

death_registry |>
  select(CIVIC_CENTRE, DEATH_LICENSES) |>
  slice(1:10) |>
  kable(
    caption = "First ten rows"
  )
```
