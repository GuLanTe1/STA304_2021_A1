Thank you for taking your precious time to read my project! :)

This project is all about Death Registry Statistics and its relations to COVID-19.

Two CSV datasets and an Rmd file have been uploaded to my Github repo. You can download them to your device for reproducibility tests.

And a pdf file of my work is also available for your best convenience to read.

Please take your time to discover my findings, and I hope you enjoy my content.

Cheers, and stay safe!
